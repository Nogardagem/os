# Why Only Assembly?

> When I say "assembly" here, it means x86 assembly

## TL;DR

- What's the point in using a (relatively) high-level language when you're working with machine operations anyway
- I want to know what the computer is doing in my OS
- I want to make [my own assembly editor](my-own-assembly-editor.md)
- I want to learn assembly
- Assembly acts like a puzzle (and I love puzzles)
- I like optimization, and assembly needs it

## Why?

The main reason I want to use assembly only is because I don't see the point in creating an OS if I don't. If you're creating an operating system, you likely (as I do) care about performance and optimization in it. In order to have the maximum amount of that, you need to know what the program you're creating is actually doing behind the scenes. A decent amount of this becomes abstracted when you choose to use C/C++, as they place in many assembly operations for each line of their code. Assembly even abstracts a few things, which I plan to address and explain with [my own assembly editor](my-own-assembly-editor.md).

Another quite basic reason I'm choosing assembly-only is because I've wanted to learn assembly for a while, and this acts as the perfect opportunity to force myself to. I think assembly and assembly-like languages are also very interesting and fun to work with, as then turn into a sort of puzzle that requires arranging each machine operation correctly. I also love the process of optimizing any code, and in most other languages there's not much of a point to it. In assembly, however, you always want to optimize to the maximum degree, and there are always intersting ways to do so.
