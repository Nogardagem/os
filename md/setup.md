# Setup

[Back to the README](../README.md)
This is an explanation of my process for downloading, installing, and setting up the tools I've used to make my OS. As I am using Windows, all of these explanations will (likely) be Windows-specific.

## NASM

[NASM](https://www.nasm.us/) is a popular choice of assembler for projects invloving the use of x86 assembly, and was the assembler of choice for me. The process for downloading and installing NASM was relatively simple. I found the [Windows x64 installer](https://www.nasm.us/pub/nasm/releasebuilds/2.16.03/win64/) and ran it, leaving most settings alone, but ensuring it was downloaded to `C:/Program Files/nasm/`.

## QEMU
