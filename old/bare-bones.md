## The Bare Bones Tutorial

The [Bare Bones tutorial](https://wiki.osdev.org/Bare_Bones) is given on [OSDev](https://wiki.osdev.org/) as "the first step in creating your own operating system".

There are several large sections in this tutorial, so I will give them their own pages.

1. [Building a Cross-Compiler](t1-gcc.md)
2. [Overview](t2-overview.md)
