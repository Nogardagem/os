# Setup
## Downloading tools
All of this is using Windows, which means some extra tools are required

First is [Cygwin](https://wiki.osdev.org/Cygwin), which effectively emulates a UNIX environment

[Cygwin.com](https://www.cygwin.com/) is the website to download

For windows, [this](https://wiki.osdev.org/GCC_Cross-Compiler#Preparing_for_the_build:~:text=build%20from%20there-,Windows%20Users,-Windows%20users%20need) is where the required Cygwin packages are. Add these in from the setup/installer program downloaded from [Cygwin](http://cygwin.com/install.html).

The package selector thing is weird, but to select a package for download you just search in the search bar, then double-click on "skip" and it'll switch to the latest release version to be downloaded.
